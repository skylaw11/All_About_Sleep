# All_About_Sleep
This App will give you a summary of sleep data. There are 2 datasets available to view, sleep in students
and sleep in mammals. You can compare each parameters for each datasets to see trends in Sleep patterns. 
Below are the data columns present for each data sets.

Student's Sleep Data: Data which show the effect of two soporific drugs
(increase in hours of sleep compared to control) on 10 patients.
COLUMNS:
[, 1]	extra	numeric	increase in hours of sleep
[, 2]	group	factor	drug given
[, 3]	ID	factor	patient ID


Mamal's Sleep: This data set includes data for 39 species of mammals distributed over 13 orders. 
The data were used for analyzing the relationship between constitutional and ecological factors and 
sleeping in mammals. Two qualitatively different sleep variables (dreaming and non dreaming) were recorded. 
Constitutional variables such as life span, body weight, brain weight and gestation time were evaluated. 
Ecological variables such as severity of predation, safety of sleeping place and overall danger were 
inferred from field observations in the literature.
COLUMNS:
[, 1]Species:Species of mammals
[, 2]BodyWt:Total body weight of the mammal (in kg)
[, 3]BrainWt:Brain weight of the mammal (in kg)
[, 4]NonDreaming:Number of hours of non dreaming sleep
[, 5]Dreaming:Number of hours of dreaming sleep
[, 6]TotalSleep:Total number of hours of sleep
[, 7]LifeSpan:Life span (in years)
[, 8]Gestation:Gestation time (in days)
[, 9]Predation:An index of how likely the mammal is to be preyed upon. 
  1 = least likely to be preyed upon. 5 = most likely to be preyed upon.
[, 10]Exposure:An index of the how exposed the mammal is during sleep. 
  1 = least exposed (e.g., sleeps in a well-protected den). 5 = most exposed.
[, 11]Danger:An index of how much danger the mammal faces from other animals. 
  This index is based upon Predation and Exposure. 1 = least danger from other animals. 
  5 = most danger from other animals.
